# ðŸ§  SQL-Based Analysis Overview â€“ Cyclistic Case Study

In this phase of the Cyclistic bike-share case study, SQL (Google BigQuery) was used to explore, clean, and analyze millions of ride records from Q1 2019 and Q1 2020.

The purpose of this SQL-based analysis is to:
- Understand the structure and size of the dataset.
- Create summary statistics for ride durations.
- Identify usage patterns across weekdays and user types (casual vs. member).
- Prepare unified datasets for cross-year comparison and visualization.

By using SQL, we ensured:
- Scalable processing of large datasets.
- Fast aggregation and transformation operations.
- Clean, queryable data for downstream reporting and business recommendations.

This analysis directly supports the main business question:
> **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

All queries, outputs, and visual screenshots used during this phase are documented in this section.
